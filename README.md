This project is ment to explore how teleworking and working from home can affect workers and their industires. The analysis uses publicically available datasets to help answer the bleow research questions.

## Primary Research Questions 
- What percentage of people work from home vs. in person?
- Which industries have the highest telework rates?
- What is the average age and education level of teleworkers?
- How many hours do teleworkers work compared to in-person workers?

- [WFH Research](https://wfhresearch.com/)

Both Of these datsets are stored on this GitHub in the folder `DataSets/`.

`Project.ipynb` is the Jupyter Notebook containing the code, visuals, and analysis.
`DataSets/` is the folder holding all the datasets used in the analysis.

## How to Run
1. Open the Juptyter File `Project.ipynb`.
2. All data and datasets used in the Juptyter file is tooken from this GitHub making no other downloading necessary.
3. Run all cells from top to bottom to see the analysis.
